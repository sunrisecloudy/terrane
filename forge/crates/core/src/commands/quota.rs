//! `quota.status` + `quota.set` — the DL-22 user-facing quota commands
//! (prd-merged/02 DL-22, `forge/spec/quotas.md`).
//!
//! These are the COMMAND boundary over the `forge-storage` quota substrate
//! (`Store::quota_usage` / `quota_policy` / `set_quota_policy`):
//!
//!   - [`cmd_quota_status`](super::super::WorkspaceCore::cmd_quota_status) REPORTS the
//!     deterministic usage vs. the trusted limits, plus the non-blocking
//!     APPROACHING-LIMIT warnings (a budget at/above its threshold) carrying the DL-22
//!     remedy suggestion (compaction / cleanup / export — never deletion). It is a
//!     pure read of persisted state, so it replays byte-identically.
//!   - [`cmd_quota_set`](super::super::WorkspaceCore::cmd_quota_set) CONFIGURES the
//!     trusted [`QuotaPolicy`] override (quotas are user-configurable). This is a
//!     PRIVILEGED, trust-gated admin op: the command-level RBAC gate
//!     ([`authorize`](super::super::auth::authorize)) restricts it to the Owner, and
//!     the override is persisted in the LOCAL-ONLY KV namespace, so it stays per-install
//!     config that enforcement reads from durable state — never from the write being
//!     checked. A write can therefore never widen its own quota.
//!
//! CONFIG IS TRUSTED STATE (the DL-22 lesson): the *enforcement* read of the policy
//! (`enforce_records_write_tx` / `put_attachment`) always comes from persisted state,
//! and the only way to change it is this Owner-gated command — not an applet's `ctx.*`
//! request payload. `quota.status` likewise reads the trusted policy + the persisted
//! usage, with no wall clock on the path, so the report is deterministic.
